We value and welcome both feature requests and contributions (PRs) that enhance Nauthera. Our community is at the heart of what we do, and your input drives our progress!

## Submitting a Feature Request or Contribution

If you’re thinking about adding a feature, here’s how to ensure your contribution gets the attention it deserves and is merged efficiently:

1. **Create an Issue First**: 
   - Open a GitHub issue to propose your feature or improvement. This allows maintainers and the community to discuss your idea.
   - Alternatively, bring up your feature in a community meeting for open discussion about its design and implementation.

2. **Keep It Small (If Possible)**:
   - Smaller contributions are easier to review and merge. If you can scope your feature into smaller parts, we encourage you to do so.

### Feature Sizing: Getting Your Change Accepted

We evaluate contributions based on their size and significance. Here’s how we approach it:

### Smaller Features
- These typically involve minimal code changes and are easy to review.
- If you believe your feature is small, feel free to directly open a PR.
- Share the PR link in the community Slack channel for quick feedback and discussion.
- If maintainers determine it’s larger than anticipated, they’ll guide you on next steps.

### Larger Features
- For larger changes or if you’re unsure about the size, discuss your idea first before raising a PR.
- This ensures alignment with the project’s roadmap and helps avoid unnecessary effort.
- Early discussions make it easier to collaboratively shape the design and implementation.

## Best Practices for Contributions
- Ensure your feature aligns with Nautheras vision and design principles.
- Write clear, maintainable code with appropriate documentation.
- Include relevant tests to validate your changes.
