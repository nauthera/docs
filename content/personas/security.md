Nauthera empowers security teams to establish and enforce robust, consistent authentication policies across the entire organization without becoming a bottleneck.

## The Challenge of Centralized Security

In many organizations, security teams are faced with a difficult balancing act: they need to ensure that all applications adhere to strict security standards, but they also need to avoid slowing down the development process. This often leads to:

*   **Manual Toil**: Security engineers spend a significant amount of time manually reviewing and approving requests for OIDC clients.
*   **Inconsistent Policies**: Without a centralized, automated way to enforce policies, it's easy for inconsistencies to creep in, leading to a weaker security posture.
*   **Lack of Visibility**: It can be difficult to get a clear, up-to-date picture of all the OIDC clients in use across the organization and the security policies that are being applied to them.

## The Nauthera Approach: Centralized Governance, Delegated Execution

Nauthera provides a powerful solution to these challenges by allowing security teams to define and manage authentication policies as code.

### Define Your Policies in YAML

Create `AuthPolicy` resources that define the security constraints for different types of applications (e.g., web apps, mobile apps, backend services).

```yaml
apiVersion: auth.nauthera.io/v1alpha1
kind: AuthPolicy
metadata:
  name: web-apps-policy
  namespace: security
spec:
  token:
    accessTokenTTL: "15m"
    refreshTokenTTL: "24h"
  allowedGrantTypes:
    - "authorization_code"
    - "refresh_token"
  enforcePKCE: true
  allowedScopes:
    - openid
    - profile
    - email
    - "api:read"
```

### Store Policies in a Central Git Repository

Manage your `AuthPolicy` resources in a dedicated, security-controlled Git repository.

### Automatic Enforcement

The Nauthera operator automatically validates all `AuthClient` requests against the relevant policies. Any request that does not comply with the policy is rejected, with immediate feedback provided to the developer via the Kubernetes API.

### Key Benefits for Security Teams

*   **Automated Governance**: Enforce security policies automatically, without manual intervention.
*   **Consistency**: Ensure that all applications are configured with a consistent and robust security posture.
*   **Auditability**: Maintain a complete, version-controlled audit trail of all policy changes in Git.
*   **Agility**: Update security policies in one place and have the changes automatically rolled out to all affected clients.
